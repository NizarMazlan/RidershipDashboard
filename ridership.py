            This project is centered around data visualizations derived from the field of transportation, with a specific focus on ridership data for both rail and bus systems in Malaysia. The visualizations we've explored encompass a range of insights and patterns within this dataset, helping us better understand and analyze the dynamics of public transportation in the country.

            These visualizations include heatmaps that reveal the density of ridership, total ridership trends over time, monthly averages, ridership patterns by the day of the week, and line charts depicting ridership changes over time. Additionally, we utilize heatmaps for a unique perspective on ridership patterns over time, comparing weekend and weekday ridership through area charts, and examining the distribution of ridership for in-depth analysis.

            Through these visualizations, we aim to shed light on the intricacies of Malaysia's transportation systems, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the nation's mission to become a prominent data-driven country.
